# Claudia.js example static documentation

This is just a small example to make the docs of claudiajs as a static website, so it is easier to get up and running with it.

* Run `npm install`
* To watch the docs start `./node_modules/.bin/harp server` and open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to check out
* To create a static website, run `./node_modules/.bin/harp compile`
